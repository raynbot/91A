- 👋 Hi, I’m @raynbot
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to the customization of a device or software, as well as bot programming and AI capabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and eventually other coding languages to help with building a career.
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any project with the understanding that I am new to github and coding in general.
